## Background and Overview

`Space Putt Putt` is a mini golf game that is out of this world. The coures is 
made up of 9 holes and is played just like the normal mini golf game you know 
and love. The player will attempt to get the ball in the hole in the least 
amount of strokes as possible. 

The player starts off with a view of the hole and decides where on the starting
mat to place the ball. The player will then use the mouse to go behind the ball
and take a shot (with a click). The distance from the mouse to the ball will 
determine the velocity of the shot. The ball will eventually stop rolling and 
then the player will take another shot until the ball goes in the hole.
